# README

This app was created as part of the Odin Project curriculum, for the project:
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only">Members Only!</a>

It's meant to train/test authentication and authorization, using the DEVISE gem.

I personally customized it with the idea of it being a simple 'shower thoughts' app, in which people can share a daily profound thought.

While for other users, shower thoughts are purely anonymous, for the Master-Plumber (aka admin), shower thoughts have a visible user.

Eventually, I may add (time/energy/skill permitting) another class of user, the Plumber, a randomly selected daily user who can choose the most profound and most funny thought of the day.
